# Referendum Costituzionale 2016
I solved the exercise twice:
  1) with Python (pandas + numpy libraries) 
  2) with Scala + Spark 
  
At the end of each procedure, results obtained have been compared

Solution source code can be found in directories: 
  1) Python -> code_python  
  2) Scala + Spark -> code_scala
  
Output csv files can be found in directory: 
  - output -> output_python : csv file produced by python notebooks
  - output -> output_scala_spark : csv file produced by spark-shell code
  
Initial dataset and intermediate files can be found at: 
  - resources -> ScrutiniFI.csv : original dataset
  - resources -> ScrutiniFI_cleaned : cleaned dataset
